# CogLogs: A Toontown Calculator

## What is CogLogs, anyways?

CogLogs is a new simple way to calculate how many cog facilities a toon needs in order to be ready for a promotion!

Originally made in Java and Kotlin, the new and improved CogLogs will be cross-platform made with Flutter (Dart) and published to an app store near you--COMING SOON!

## What's Toontown?
Toontown Rewritten (TTR) is a turn-based Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) based on Disney’s now-defunct Toontown Online, which ran from 2002 to 2013. TTR takes place in the fictional world of Toontown, where wacky and colorful cartoon characters called ‘Toons’ reside. In the game, an army of dull corporate robots known as ‘Cogs’ attack the town to put an end to their fun. Lucky for toons, the Cogs can’t take a joke, so Toons fight the Cogs by using gags. Toons fight the cogs by defeating them on the streets, in cog buildings (which were originally toon buildings), and in the Cog Headquarters.

There are four types of Cogs invading Toontown: Bossbots, Lawbots, Cashbots, and Sellbots. Each of the different Cog types have their own respective headquarters, and each headquarter contains different cog facilities where Toons may go to fight cogs. One major feature of Toontown is the ability to go fight the Cogs’ boss battles; Each cog type has their own version of a boss battle: Sellbots have the VP, Cashbots have the CFO, Lawbots have the CJ, and Bossbots have the CEO. In order to go fight any of these big bosses, Toons must acquire a cog disguise and earn enough ‘points’ to be ‘Ready for a Promotion!’ so they can sneak inside the Cog Boss facilities. These points each have a different name for each Cog Type: Bossbots must earn Stock Options, Lawbots must earn Jury Notices, Cashbots must earn Cogbucks, and Sellbots must earn Merits; all of these can be obtained by fighting enough Cogs. After defeating the Cog Boss, the Toon’s suit disguise earns a promotion, and they must fight more Cogs to earn more points to be ready for another promotion, and the process continues to repeat.

The problem every toon in Toontown faces is knowing exactly how many cog facilities they need to earn a promotion, which is where **CogLogs** comes in: to help toons automatically calculate how many facilities they need based on what suit level they are. Using the app, all you need to input is how many points you need, how many you’ve already obtained, and what cog suit type you are calculating. The app will output a string of exactly how many facilities they need.

## That sounds like a lot of redundant coding

Not with software architecture it isn't! The backend of the app is technically already done. It uses an interface and abstract superclass to calculate the correct cog suit based on what type of cog is chosen. It just needs to be implemented to work with the Flutter app (COMING SOON!!!)

## You keep saying "Coming soon"--when will this project be finished?

Lol
